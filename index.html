<p>Here is another story. Once upon the time Ludwig Feuerbach strived to defend Hegel's vision of the evolving human spirit against Christian tendencies to go very much over the <em>imaginative</em> border of physics. As human feels there should be no borders and as he is desiring to be with no borders, he is making objective this desire of his.  The nature of this feeling, pure unlimited feeling made objective is the God. As this idea of God needs further objectification, the idea of Christ is born. Christ, according to Feuerbach is actually a satisfied desire of man for personal limitless existence. Christ's resurrection is a final proof that even the death is not a limit which cannot be crossed. Modern theologians are facing serious accusations if their writings are found to be feuerbachian or hegelian, whatsoever. Writings of spanish theologian  Andr√©s Torres Queiruga was so  judged to be very near to Feuerbach in his interpretation of mankind which is constantly being realized through nourishing it's ability to see the world with an endless affection and admiration. We may try to find the sources of this accusations in the categorical discourse (we owe this term to R. W. Connel) by which the straight Christian, Catholic nay, interpretation of the human spirit does not want to temper with the attempts to explain things in generic, natural or immanent discourse without leaving more than enough room for personal, supernatural and transcendent God. It is even more so interesting to watch the fights being fought over this <em>no mans land</em>.  </p>

<p>Long time ago it became painfully obvious but rarely spoken aloud that, what Feuerbach later calling objectification of unlimited feeling, of free will, of self-consciousness... does not end in realms of religion. We find ourselves limited but God is unlimited. We find our will to be corrupted, but God is uncorrupted, we find our self-consciousness to be revealing our weak sins that only God can overcome.  But let's try this. We find the world hunted by demons which is enlightened by the science to see that there is no demons. To one, the candle is Christ as we read in the book of the Revelation by John (Revelation of John 21:23), to other, the candle is science as we read in the book The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan. The science is the one to overcome all human weaknesses as we partially proved with the case of the sick and hungry mean who needs no prayers but cure and bread. So, is it God or is it science that will overcome those acknowledged weaknesses?</p>

<p>Richard Rorty made an fascinating move forward addressing the human weakness from completely different point of view. The issue he noticed is that in, what Heidegger had called "tradition of Western Metaphysics" we are all sort of <em>doomed</em> to seek for a theory. A theory that claims to see a considerable great, if not all the possible, territory, from a distance as far as possible.  Considering great number of different theories, those kinds of view is only remotely related to what is called "love for wisdom" or a <em>philosophy</em>. Rorty, calling himself an ironist, is trying to grasp all of those different, particular and, in the end, contingent, theories into one view.  This view, which is purely historical and not so theoretical, sees weaknesses and greatnesses of all those successive theories. It sees different persons in different parts of human history and different parts of world, different parts of cultural heritage, writing different books about same and different things. This view see an unity which is common to all of these historical attempts. This unity, now clearly seen, leaves the ironist free of an urge to theorize. The urge which gradually leads to the trap of defining one definite vocabulary which will rule them all.  Also, the urge is not manifested only in the realms of philosophy but also in the science. Science helped build a secularized culture in which, Rorty argues, scientists had taken the role of the priests. Their role is to keep the humanity in touch with something beyond itself. Everything except the <em>truth</em> is characterised as too <em>subjective</em> to be held. Social sciences, because the lack of the methods and the technology that supports natural sciences, coin terms like "behavioral sciences" which sounds technical enough to keep them in the quasi-priestly order.  Other choice they have is to be concerned with <em>values</em> as opposed to <em>facts</em>. However, in those <em>values</em> they seek for one that can be postulated as objective and thus treated as fact. This approach constitutes a pseudo-mythology because, as Feuerbach earlier noticed, it objectifies the human wish for an unlimited value. The public, however, treats both those discourses - one of the natural science  that is<em>natural</em> and <em>objective</em>, and other - of philosophy and literal criticism - which try to deserve their portion of <em>natural</em> and <em>objectivity</em>  - as equally amusing. They all provide means of pleasure rather than truth. Feuerbach would surely agree that unlimited amusement made objective is what both God and science should become if they want to survive in cultural environment of nowadays. </p>
