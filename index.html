Davor started writing reasonably early in his life as probably most writers did. He wrote several short stories and poems. Most of it got published somewhere in mid nineties. However, with the dawn of 21st century he almost completely stopped writing. But, fortunately or not, he is back. In both his fiction and non fiction works he is trying to contribute to the development of the fragile culture of dialogue. Davor is holdig a masters degree in theology. He is employed with a software start-up so he knows to appreciate that little free time he has. He is happily married.">

 <h1>Girl with Broken Umbrella</h1>
 <p><b>What do art and terrorism have in common? In what kind of trouble acreative mind can take you?</b></p>
                                    

<p>Ana is a journalist who discovers an important manuscript and a gifted cartoonist whose

life is in danger. David is a philosopher and an author of a story collection about the war

in Bosnia. Boris is an innovative artist. Fabian – a future cleric. Pierre is a friend.</p>


<p>Their stories are not ordinary. Everything about their lives is mysteriously connected

with other people, and distant times and places. Every detail has many meanings, and

their paths are defined by those meanings.</p>


<p>They will take you to the streets of Zagreb, through the basements and art studios, to a

book fair and an explosive factory. They will lead you into a secret society quarters, an

interrogation room at the Russian border, and eventually to Paris.</p>


<p>You’ll walk near the battlefield, through a gay parade, and into the target of a terrorist

attack.</p>


<p>Disguised as the main characters’ journey through the time and places, this actually is a

fascinating semantic journey. Things around you will never look the same again.</p>							</p>

The city was unusually crowded for this time of year; Midsummer. Walking in groups is funny; impossible to engage in conversation with all in the same time, David thought while trying to decide whether to talk to Jakov and the other Jakov about the weather or to Mihael and Denis about perils of work in the fashion industry.</p></blockquote>

You never know what gem you can dig and for a reasonable price too. However, books by this particular seller didn't look promising at all. They are mostly cheap fiction and books about knitting.</p></blockquote>
