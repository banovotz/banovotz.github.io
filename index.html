<p>Here is another story. Once upon the time Ludwig Feuerbach strived to defend Hegel's vision of the evolving human spirit against Christian tendencies to go very much over the <em>imaginative</em> border of physics. As people feel there should be no borders and as they are  desiring to be without borders, they make  this desire objective.  The nature of this feeling, pure unlimited feeling, made objective, is the God. As this idea of God needs further objectification, the idea of Christ is born. Christ, according to Feuerbach, is actually a satisfied desire of man for personal limitless existence. Christ's resurrection is then a final proof that even the death is not a limit which cannot be crossed. </p>
<p>Modern theologians are facing serious accusations if their writings are found to be feuerbachian or hegelian. Writings of spanish theologian  Andr√©s Torres Queiruga was so  judged to be very near to Feuerbach in his interpretation of mankind that constantly realizes itself through nourishing it's ability to see the world with an endless affection and admiration. We may try to find the sources of this accusations in a discourse we can, with R.W. Connel call a categorical discourse. If one want to call himself a Christian, Catholic nay, then he should watch carefully that his interpretation of the human spirit does not  attempt in any way to explain things in generic, natural or immanent discourse. There should be always more than enough room for personal, supernatural and transcendent God. So, every view that is remotely resembling to immanentism is most likely to be judged as feuerbachian. When Paul writes " I no longer live, but Christ lives in me"  (Galatians 2:20), this is to be interpreted in the way that Christ is the real personal source of free personal life not an  horizon of desires of mankind made objective by the early christian movement. While answering that question, we  dig categorical trenches to fight over <em>a man</em> who is still a <em>no mans land</em>  merely periodically occupied by different interpretational forces strong enough to put borders around metaphysical grounds.  Those wins are good enough for masses but never good enough for  a man who want to be without borders. </p>
<p>Long time ago became painfully obvious but rarely spoken aloud that, what Feuerbach later called - objectification of unlimited feeling, of free will, of self-consciousness -  does not end in realms of religion.  Yes, religion did very early in history filled in the gap that desperately needed to be filled. We find ourselves limited but God is unlimited. We find our will to be corrupted, but God is uncorrupted, we find our self-consciousness to be hiding to us our weak sins that only God can overcome.  So, we tried to be real and invented science as religion was obviously not enough to deal with our mess. So, here we are, in the world hunted by demons which is enlightened by the science to see that there is no demons. To one, the candle is Christ as we read in the book of the Revelation by John (Revelation of John 21:23), to other, the candle is science as we read in the book The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan. The science is the one to overcome all human weaknesses as we partially proved with the case of the sick and hungry men who needs no prayers but cure and bread. </p>
<p>But, is it God or is it science that will overcome those acknowledged weaknesses?</p>
<p>Richard Rorty made an fascinating move forward addressing the human weakness from completely different point of view. The issue he noticed is that in, what Heidegger had called "tradition of Western Metaphysics," we all are sort of <em>doomed</em> to seek for a theory. A theory that claims to see all  from a distance as far as possible.  Considering great number of different theories that has answers to all questions and express no real desire for dialogue, we can hardly call those theories "love for wisdom" or a <em>philosophy</em>. Rorty, calling himself an ironist, is trying to grasp all of those different, particular and, in the end, contingent, theories into one view.  This view, which is purely historical and not so theoretical, sees weaknesses and greatnesses of all those successive theories. It sees different persons in different parts of human history, different parts of world and with different parts of cultural heritage, writing different books about same and different things. This view see an unity which is common to all of these historical attempts. This unity, now clearly seen, leaves the ironist free of an urge to theorize. The urge which gradually leads to the trap of defining one definite vocabulary which will rule them all. And the urge is not manifested only in the realms of philosophy or religion to be frank, but also in the science. Science helped build a secularized culture in which, Rorty argues, scientists had taken the role of the priests. Their role is to keep the humanity in touch with something beyond itself. Everything except the <em>truth</em> is characterized as too <em>subjective</em> to be considered serious. Social sciences, because the lack of the methods and the technology that supports natural sciences, coin terms like "behavioral sciences" which sounds technical enough to keep them in the quasi-priestly order.  Other choice they have is to be concerned with <em>values</em> as opposed to <em>facts</em>. However, in those <em>values</em> they seek for one that can be postulated as objective and thus treated as fact. This approach constitutes a pseudo-mythology because, as Feuerbach earlier noticed, it objectifies the human wish for an unlimited value. </p>
<p>The public, however, treats both those discourses - one of the natural science  that is_natural_ and <em>objective</em>, and other - of philosophy or theology - which try to deserve their portion of <em>natural</em> and <em>objectivity</em>  - as equally amusing. They all provide means of pleasure rather than truth. Feuerbach would surely agree that unlimited amusement made objective is what both God and science should become if they want to survive in cultural environment of nowadays. </p>
