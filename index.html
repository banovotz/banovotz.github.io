Does the fact that we have new and shiny hiking shoes in our possession makes us a hiker? Are we boxing connoisseurs if we remember some cool facts from a collectable card of Mohammad <b>Ali</b> we had when we were kids? How much is our <i>personal</i> attitude affected by our <i>professional</i> interest in some subject? The book <i>Reusable Cross, Irony of religious spin</i> begins as the story of a boy who, as years are passing, gradually becomes aware how many of our present personal attitudes, opinions and <i>statements of faith or those of unbelief</i>  have their origin in our early youth or are picked up in a dogmatic fashion and never elaborated. We are too often satisfied with answers and feeling about stuff that we adopted somewhere along the way. We shoot readily those answers as <i>Slumdog millionaire</i> on a quiz trivia too happy that we do not need to bother any more with finding them and completely ignoring that <i>truth is always new</i>. Do we need to get lost in mountains in order to realize that pair of hiking shoes does not make us a hiker no matter what smiling people from billboard are trying to convince us? So we can blame just about anybody teaching us wrong stuff. Commercials or preachers or even philosophy professors, as Arthur <b>Schopenhauer</b> ironically claims.  But we can also dare to be wise, <i>Sapere Aude</i> as <b>Kant</b> suggested, even if this dare puts us before rocky roads of still heavily unexplored nooks of what we call <i>truth</i>. And then the real fun part starts. If we are becoming more and more familiar with different opinions, that doesn't mean that we are not victims of <i>philosophia sectaria</i> favoring <b>St. Paul's</b> writing on Christ over that of <b>Feuerbach</b>. Or Richard <b>Dawkins</b>' rendering of idea of God rather than that of Karl <b>Rahner</b>. Afraid not to get <i>under influence</i> of <i>opinion makers</i> and <i>spin doctors</i>, we may as well enter the ploy under the beatific veil of <i>religious spin</i> we weave for ourselves. Ironically, the <i>answer</i> we may be looking for may be lying in the irony itself.

       <p>Here is another story. Once upon the time Ludwig Feuerbach strived to defend Hegel's vision of the evolving human spirit against Christian tendencies to go very much over the <em>imaginative</em> border of physics. As people feel there should be no borders and as they are  desiring to be without borders, they make  this desire objective.  The nature of this feeling, pure unlimited feeling, made objective, is the God. Dawkins later tried to make more scientific approach to this general idea of Feuerbach by introducing genes pendandts - memes with God meme as one that still survives, but Feauerbach idea was surely good enough for making a point in direction that all that God is is actually an idea that just isn't leaving human mind. <em>Au contraire</em>. As this idea of God needs further objectification, the new idea - idea of Christ -  is born. Christ,  Feuerbach says, is actually a satisfied desire of man for personal limitless existence. Christ's resurrection is then a final proof that even the death is not a limit which cannot be crossed. </p>
<p>Modern theologians are facing serious accusations if their writings are found to be feuerbachian or hegelian. Writings of spanish theologian  Andr√©s Torres Queiruga was so  judged to be very near to Feuerbach in his interpretation of mankind that constantly realizes itself through nourishing it's ability to see the world with an endless affection and admiration. We may try to find the sources of this accusations in a discourse we can, with R.W. Connel call a categorical discourse. If one want to call himself a Christian, Catholic nay, then he should watch carefully that his interpretation of the human spirit does not  attempt in any way to explain things in generic, natural or immanent discourse. There should be always more than enough room for personal, supernatural and transcendent God. So, every view that is remotely resembling to immanentism is most likely to be judged as feuerbachian. When Paul writes " I no longer live, but Christ lives in me"  (Galatians 2:20), this is to be interpreted in the way that Christ is the real personal source of free personal life not an  horizon of desires of mankind made objective by the early christian movement. While answering that question, we  dig categorical trenches to fight over <em>a man</em> who is still a <em>no mans land</em>  merely periodically occupied by different interpretational forces strong enough to put borders around metaphysical grounds.  Those wins are good enough for masses but never good enough for  a man who want to be without borders. </p>
<p>Long time ago became painfully obvious but rarely spoken aloud that, what Feuerbach later called - objectification of unlimited feeling, of free will, of self-consciousness -  does not end in realms of religion.  Yes, religion did very early in history filled in the gap that desperately needed to be filled. We find ourselves limited but God is unlimited. We find our will to be corrupted, but God is uncorrupted, we find our self-consciousness to be hiding to us our weak sins that only God can overcome.  So, we tried to be real and invented science as religion was obviously not enough to deal with our mess. So, here we are, in the world hunted by demons which is enlightened by the science to see that there is no demons. To one, the candle is Christ as we read in the book of the Revelation by John (Revelation of John 21:23), to other, the candle is science as we read in the book The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan. The science is the one to overcome all human weaknesses as we partially proved with the case of the sick and hungry men who needs no prayers but cure and bread. </p>
<p>But, is it God or is it science that will overcome those acknowledged weaknesses?</p>
<p>Richard Rorty made an fascinating move forward addressing the human weakness from completely different point of view. The issue he noticed is that in, what Heidegger had called "tradition of Western Metaphysics," we all are sort of <em>doomed</em> to seek for a theory. A theory that claims to see all  from a distance as far as possible.  Considering great number of different theories that has answers to all questions and express no real desire for dialogue, we can hardly call those theories "love for wisdom" or a <em>philosophy</em>. Rorty, calling himself an ironist, is trying to grasp all of those different, particular and, in the end, contingent, theories into one view.  This view, which is purely historical and not so theoretical, sees weaknesses and greatnesses of all those successive theories. It sees different persons in different parts of human history, different parts of world and with different parts of cultural heritage, writing different books about same and different things. This view see an unity which is common to all of these historical attempts. This unity, now clearly seen, leaves the ironist free of an urge to theorize. The urge which gradually leads to the trap of defining one definite vocabulary which will rule them all. And the urge is not manifested only in the realms of philosophy or religion to be frank, but also in the science. Science helped build a secularized culture in which, Rorty argues, scientists had taken the role of the priests. Their role is to keep the humanity in touch with something beyond itself. Everything except the <em>truth</em> is characterized as too <em>subjective</em> to be considered serious. Social sciences, because the lack of the methods and the technology that supports natural sciences, coin terms like "behavioral sciences" which sounds technical enough to keep them in the quasi-priestly order.  Other choice they have is to be concerned with <em>values</em> as opposed to <em>facts</em>. However, in those <em>values</em> they seek for one that can be postulated as objective and thus treated as fact. We may readily note that approach constitutes a pseudo-mythology because, as Feuerbach earlier noticed, it objectifies the human wish for an unlimited value. </p>
<p>To be honest, the <em>truth</em>  presumably captivated by those theories does not always take the wholeness into account which constitutes a new problem.  Physicist David Bohm notices that art, sciences, technology... all human activities are divided into specialties which are generally considered to be essentially separated from each other. Because it is clearly visible that this condition is not satisfactory for long run, man invented interdisciplinary subjects in order to unite those specialities. However, this leads to even more fragmentation. And general fragmentation of humanity is a fact from the <em>beginning of time</em> as Bible would say and so says Bohm. Nations, religions, races... people are destined to live in separate groups. This fragmentation goes even further in the very person who generally may have problems avoiding conflicts caused by his own different desires, aims and ambitions. Because we are unable to comprehend the wholeness, Bohm says, we created a world  which dwells in great disorders in economic, ecological, political spheres, you name it. </p>
